# python-for-robotics-foundations
A focused Python learning repository built to prepare for robotics and AI. Covers Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and math-oriented programming with applications toward robotics systems.

# Python for Robotics Foundations

This repository documents my focused learning of Python fundamentals in preparation for robotics and artificial intelligence work.

The goal of this repository is not to learn Python in isolation, but to build a solid programming foundation that supports robotics concepts such as system modeling, control logic, numerical computation, and simulation.

## Why this repository exists
Robotics requires strong fundamentals in programming, mathematics, and logical problem-solving.  
This repository serves as my structured approach to learning Python with a robotics-first mindset before moving on to robotics-specific tools and frameworks.

## What this repository covers
- Core Python programming concepts
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Math-oriented programming using Python
- Foundational tools required for robotics and AI work

## Learning approach
- Learn concepts deeply, not by memorization
- Write code from scratch and understand every line
- Document key insights and challenges
- Build foundations before moving to robotics systems

## What comes next
After completing these Python foundations, I will begin documenting my robotics learning journey, applying these skills to robotics-specific concepts and projects.
